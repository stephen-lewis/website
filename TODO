I've kind of jumped to 6... but I think it makes 2 and then 1 easier. Restructuring also helps 3 and 4 I think. 5
becomes redundant; but could be replaced with 'make existing jQuery code work in React without needing jQuery'.

Also CSS clean up is more like - remove from global and tie to component. There will still be some global though I think.
