    <h3>I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and problems</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Engineering design</strong>, <strong>computer programming</strong>,
      and <strong>management</strong> all offer continual challenges to find solutions to often
      complex problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made a career as a <strong>systems engineer</strong> and a
      <strong>mechanical design engineer</strong>, developing bespoke equipment. I started on the
      workshop floor, and now, as <strong>engineering manager</strong>, I now lead a
      multidisciplinary team of engineers developing the best solutions for our customers at the
      highest quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always had an <strong>affinity for computers</strong>. I learnt to program at a very
      young age and have found both joy and many practical uses working with computers. This has
      allowed me to develop a secondary set of skills that complement my engineering abilities,
      offering alternative ways to improve <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy <strong>running</strong> and <strong>hiking</strong>. At the moment much of my spare
      time is spent working on renovating our house. I&apos;m aiming to do as much as possible
      myself which is proving to be an interesting challenge!
